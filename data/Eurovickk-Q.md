app.go

1)Using panic will cause everything to stop, this is actually wrong, the error treatment should be diferent for example.

 if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to create anteHandler: %w", err)
    }

    app.SetAnteHandler(anteHandler)
    return nil
}

if err := app.setAnteHandler(txConfig, maxGasWanted, cdc, simulation); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to set ante handler: %v", err)
}

not using panic makes the app more resilient and easy to mantain.

export.go

1)The function NewCanto is used but not defined in the provided code. If NewCanto is not defined elsewhere in your project, this will cause an error.

ante.go

1)The switch tx.(type) statement is a bit redundant since you are already using tx.(authante.HasExtensionOptionsTx) to handle specific extension options. You might simplify the logic by merging these checks if possible.

handler_options.go

1)Additional validation for other fields like MaxTxGasWanted, Cdc, TxFeeChecker, and ExtensionOptionChecker might be necessary based on the application needs.

A)MaxTxGasWanted

Purpose: This parameter likely defines the maximum gas limit for a transaction. It's crucial for preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting the resources any single transaction can consume.

A value that's too low might result in valid transactions being rejected, while a value that's too high could expose the system to potential abuse.

B)Cdc (codec.BinaryCodec)

Purpose: This is the codec used for encoding and decoding binary data. It ensures that data structures are correctly serialized and deserialized.

If Cdc is not nil ensures that all binary encoding and decoding operations in the transaction handling process work correctly. If this codec is incorrectly initialized or missing, it could lead to errors in processing transactions.
