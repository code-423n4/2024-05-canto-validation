##  Lack of Post-Transfer Balance Check in `convertERC20NativeToken` Method
[msg_server.go#L354-L399](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-canto/blob/d1d51b2293d4689f467b8b1c82bba84f8f7ea008/canto-main/x/erc20/keeper/msg_server.go#L354-L399)
 In the `convertERC20NativeToken` method, after escrowing tokens on the module account, the balance of tokens is not checked again before minting coins and sending them to the receiver. Instead, only the balance of tokens before the transfer is checked against the expected value. This could potentially lead to a race condition or reentrancy vulnerability if the token balance changes unexpectedly between the initial balance check and the token transfer.
### Impact:
The lack of a post-transfer balance check leaves a window of opportunity for potential race conditions or reentrancy vulnerabilities. If the token balance changes unexpectedly between the initial balance check and the token transfer, it could lead to inaccurate token-to-coin conversion or manipulation of the conversion process by malicious actors.
### Mitigation:
Implementing this post-transfer balance check will help prevent scenarios where attackers exploit vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks or insufficient balance attacks.
