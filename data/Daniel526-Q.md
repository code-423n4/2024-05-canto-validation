## A Lack of Post-Transfer Balance Check in `convertERC20NativeToken` Method
[msg_server.go#L354-L399](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-canto/blob/d1d51b2293d4689f467b8b1c82bba84f8f7ea008/canto-main/x/erc20/keeper/msg_server.go#L354-L399)
 In the `convertERC20NativeToken` method, after escrowing tokens on the module account, the balance of tokens is not checked again before minting coins and sending them to the receiver. Instead, only the balance of tokens before the transfer is checked against the expected value. This could potentially lead to a race condition or reentrancy vulnerability if the token balance changes unexpectedly between the initial balance check and the token transfer.
### Impact:
The lack of a post-transfer balance check leaves a window of opportunity for potential race conditions or reentrancy vulnerabilities. If the token balance changes unexpectedly between the initial balance check and the token transfer, it could lead to inaccurate token-to-coin conversion or manipulation of the conversion process by malicious actors.
### Mitigation:
Implementing this post-transfer balance check will help prevent scenarios where attackers exploit vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks or insufficient balance attacks. 

## B.  Dependency Injection Limitation in Keeper Struct
[keeper.go#L15-L27](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-canto/blob/d1d51b2293d4689f467b8b1c82bba84f8f7ea008/canto-main/x/epochs/keeper/keeper.go#L15-L27)
The Keeper struct in the provided code snippet is designed to maintain collections of epochs and hooks within a module. It accepts two dependencies through its constructor: `cdc`, a codec interface for encoding and decoding data, and `storeKey`, a unique identifier for the store where data is stored. These dependencies are essential for the Keeper's operations, such as setting hooks and creating module-specific loggers.

However, the current implementation lacks the ability to inject additional dependencies or configurations dynamically. This limitation restricts the flexibility of the Keeper struct, making it challenging to extend its functionality or adapt it to different environments without modifying the source code directly. For example, if future requirements necessitate the integration of a third-party service or the use of a different storage mechanism, the current design would require changes to the `NewKeeper` function and possibly other parts of the codebase.

### Impact:
The primary impact of this limitation is reduced modularity and testability. Without the ability to inject dependencies dynamically, developers cannot easily swap out components for testing purposes or adapt the Keeper to new requirements without significant refactoring. This rigidity can lead to increased development time and maintenance effort, especially in large and evolving projects.
### Mitigation:
To address this issue, consider introducing an interface that encapsulates the core functionalities of the Keeper. This interface can then be implemented by concrete classes or structs, allowing for easy swapping and testing of components. Additionally, adopting a dependency injection framework or pattern can facilitate the dynamic injection of dependencies.
